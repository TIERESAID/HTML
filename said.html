		<h1> 12 Things I Stole From People More Successful Than Me 
   </h1>
		I’m lucky ! <br/>

	   <p> Throughout my entire life, I’ve been fortunate enough to have read 100’s of <br/>books written by people who are a lot more successful than I am. </p>

	   <p> People like  <em> Nobel Prize winner Daniel </em> Kahneman, billionaire investor <br/> Charlie Munger, Founding Father Ben Franklin, NBA legend Kobe Bryant<br/>, modern-day Stoic Ryan Holiday, and many more.</p>

	   <p> This has exposed me to thousands of new insights and practical ideas for<br/> living a better life. And let me tell you something…</p>

	   <p> I’ve happily stolen and applied every single piece <br/>of advice these people have kindly given away in their books.</p>

	    <p> Whether it’s building better habits, elevating my level of happiness, or  <br/> earning more money, these ideas have greatly benefited my own life.</p>

        I hope you enjoy it! <br/>

        For instance: <br/>
      <ul>

  <ol>
     <li> <p> Don’t tell yourself, “I have to read today. Instead, tell yourself, “I get to learn from the most intelligent and successful individuals who ever lived today.”</p> </li>


     <li> <p> Don’t tell yourself “I have to go running today.” Instead, tell yourself, “I get to build endurance and get fast today.”.</p> </li>


     <li> <p> Don’t tell yourself, “I have to read today. Instead, tell yourself, “I get to learn from the most intelligent and successful individuals who ever lived today.”</p> </li>
 </ol>
     </ul>
